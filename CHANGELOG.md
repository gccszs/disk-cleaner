- **Duplicate Detection** - Adaptive strategy automatically switches between fast and accurate modes
- **Incremental Scanning** - Cache-based optimization for 10x faster repeated scans
- **File Lock Detection** - Cross-platform file locking detection (handle.exe/lsof)
- **Process Manager** - Safe process termination for locked files
- **Interactive UI** - 5 view modes (by type, risk, age, duplicates, detailed)
- **Safety Checker** - Protected paths, file extensions, and 'YES' confirmation mechanism
- **Backup & Logging** - Automatic backup and cleanup logging

#### Platform-Specific Features
- **Windows Platform**
  - Windows Update cache detection
  - Recycle Bin cleanup
